# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
A website to provide users with a "one-stop-shop" for accessing local producers of produce and meat products. Growers/producers can log in, create a highlight page and allow costumers to search for their goods. This will provide a convenient platform for micro-growers and backyard farmers. It will promote a sense of community, bolster the local economy, and reduce the carbon footprint of one's purchases.
